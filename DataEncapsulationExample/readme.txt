3. OOPS Concepts  step by step  
    a. Abstraction: Hiding unnecessary details from consumers  
    b. Encapsulation:  Group related properties, methods and other memebers  
                       are treated as a single unit or object

    c. Inheritance: Ability to create new class based on existing class 
    d. Polymorphism: We can have multiple classes that can be used 
                     interchangeably, even though each class implements
                     same properties or methods in different ways
